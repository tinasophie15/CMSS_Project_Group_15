\section{Appendix - Overview}

The appendix can be used to add details, especially implementation aspects, or added evaluations.
There is no page limit on the appendix.
You may also report approaches that you tried, but did not work out.
Additional examples can be reported, or prompts being used for generative AI.

\section{Appendix - Usage of AI}
More details on the usage of AI: \href{https://www.tugraz.at/fileadmin/Studierende\_und\_Bedienstete/Information/Unsere\_TU\_Graz/Lehre\_an\_der\_TU\_Graz/Zitiervorschlaege_KI.pdf}{Zitiervorschlaege AI}

\section{Appendix - Figure and Table Examples}
Examples how to use figures, see Figure~\ref{fig:example} and tables, see Table~\ref{tab:contributions}.
In double, just let Latex layout the illustrations for you, or position them at the top or bottom of a page.
Is is common to capitalise nouns that are followed by numbers, as they are considered names (proper noun), e.g., Page 4.
